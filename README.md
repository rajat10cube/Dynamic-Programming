# Dynamic-Programming
This repo contains solution to some typical dynamic programming problems like bestSum(), canSum(), gridTraveller(), fibonacci(), etc
## 1. bestSum() Problem:  
Given target sum and array of numbers, return an array containing shortest Combination of numbers that add up to targetSum  
Example:  
targetSum : 8  
numbers   : [2,3,5]  
the function should return [5,3] as it is the shortest among [2,2,2,2], [5,3], [3,3,2] (numbers that add upto 8)
